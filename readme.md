# Rock Paper Scissor Detector 

 This project will detect whether you make a sign for rock, paper or scissor, this should be able to help people who've never played the game better understand how the hand signs look and clear confusion it comes to playing the game. 


## The Algorithm

The way the algorithim works is after you use the webcam and upload all of the data(pictures) you must hit the train button on your model so that it can train the machine learning mode to differentiate between the different classes. After the models is completely trained raise your hand to the webcam and make a rock paper or scissor symbol. If you've upploaded enough images and trained the model enough it should be able to tell whether it is a rock paper or scissor with very high accuracy, but if there aren't enough pictures then it's recognition will be at a much lower accuracy. 
## Running this project

To run this project run all of the boxes of code. After that a user interface with many widgets will show up, among the widgets you will see a camera and below that you will see a few things. Firstly you will see a button which gives you the option to change classes from rock paper and scissor, and you will see an add button. Use the add button to add pictures of what you want your rock paper or scissor to look like, after you are satisfied with the amount of pictures you have taken for your the class switch classes and eventually finish all of the classes. Once this is done hit the train button and fill in the amount of epochs(training cycles) you want to be completed. Once your training is finished you should be able to wave either a rock paper or scissor in front of your webcam and get a somewhat accurate prediction on what symbol your holding up.
